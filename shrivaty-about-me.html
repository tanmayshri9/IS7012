        <p>MS in Information System from University of Cincinnati.</p>

            <u>Why am I in the program?</u>
        </h3>

         <p>The relevance of this program and its curriculum cascades into the extrinsic and intrinsic functionalities of large and small-scale organisations. On the operational end, it helps in drilling down on the most agile methodologies for production and business execution. Besides, the amalgamation of technology and management as in the program also fortifies the marketing game of firms by giving them thorough insights about customer tendencies, recurring trends, and key patterns. My confident assertions about business intelligence in the section stem from my work experience. I have worked in the field of Business Intelligence and mainframe development and testing for a period of five years.  As I am now a master’s student in Information Systems, I am satiated to know that my goals and ambitions are soon to get wings to fly through. </p>
